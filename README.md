| In this project, I tackled the global challenge of providing safe drinking water by analyzing data on access to water. I debunked misconceptions and found that access to basic water services varies among income groups. Urban areas are more likely to provide basic water service. I also analyzed trends and found that rural areas require targeted interventions. Sub-Saharan Africa showed the greatest improvement in access to water. To explore the project in more detail, you can find the complete project on [GitHub](https://github.com/paschalugwu/Integrated_Project-Access_To_Drinking_Water). | This data-driven project addresses water access and quality challenges in Maji Ndogo. It uncovers insights on queue times, water sources, corruption, and infrastructure issues. The goal is to provide actionable solutions for enhancing water access, quality, and infrastructure, ensuring clean and reliable water for all.
