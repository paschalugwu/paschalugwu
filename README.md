## Projects

### Project 1. Enhancing Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water: Data Analysis and Insights.
![Dashboard Display](https://github.com/paschalugwu/paschalugwu/blob/master/Image/project1/dashboard.jpg)

In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive journey to tackle the global challenge of providing safe and affordable drinking water. The project aimed to understand and transform the data related to access to drinking water.  
 
In the first part of the project, I delved into the dataset, exploring various aspects of access to water. Through visualizations and analysis, I debunked misconceptions and uncovered insights about access to water across different income groups and population sizes. I found that the distribution of access to basic water services varied across income groups, and countries with greater urban population shares were more likely to provide basic water service. 
 
In the second part of the project, I focused on transforming the data and analyzing trends. I analyzed the dataset's time range and observed the distribution of annual rates of change for rural and urban areas. I found that more countries had higher rates of change in rural areas, indicating the need for targeted interventions in these regions. Additionally, I discovered that Sub-Saharan Africa saw the greatest improvement in access to basic water services on a national level. 
 
The project findings are showcased in a comprehensive dashboard format, providing a visual representation of the insights gained from the data analysis. The dashboard provides an overview of access to safe and affordable drinking water.

In this project, I embarked on a data-driven journey to address the challenges of water access and quality in Maji Ndogo. Through comprehensive analysis and exploration, I uncovered key insights and trends that shed light on the issues faced by the community. The project is divided into four parts: 
 
- Part 1: Beginning Your Data-Driven Journey in Maji Ndogo 
   - Analyzing patterns of water collection visits and uncovering disparities in queue times. 
   - Highlighting the need for improvements in water collection systems and concerns about data accuracy. 
   - Devising a step-by-step approach to rectify misclassifications and provide accurate representation of water quality. 
 
- Part 2: Clustering Data to Unveil Maji Ndogo's Water Crisis 
   - Exploring water sources and infrastructure conditions in Maji Ndogo. 
   - Identifying long queue times and patterns, and implications for targeted improvements. 
    
- Part 3: Weaving the Data Threads of Maji Ndogo's Narrative 
   - Investigating potential signs of corruption within the organization. 
   - Addressing the significance of the findings and their real-world implications. 
    
- Part 4: Charting the Course for Maji Ndogo's Water Future 
   - Analyzing disparities in water access and broken infrastructure. 
   - Identifying contaminated wells and proposing solutions for shared taps and reliance on rivers as water sources. 
    
The project aims to provide actionable insights and solutions to enhance water access, quality, and infrastructure in Maji Ndogo. By leveraging data-driven approaches, the project seeks to contribute to a sustainable future where clean and reliable water is accessible to all.
